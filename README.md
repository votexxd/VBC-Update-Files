# Votex's Background Changer - Update Files
On this page you will only find files wich come along with new Updates.

You obviously still need all other files in order for the Tool to work properly. Meaning if you would use this Tool for your first time, download it on our Official Website instead. -> https://votexsite.wixsite.com/vbcproject

Incase you are on an older version, lets say 1.9.2 for example, and want to update to 1.9.4 you would need to update to 1.9.3 first!

If you have any issues or need Help you can also get on our Discord. -> https://discord.gg/ybRxM4wPGM
